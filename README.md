# Translations in Dante's Inferno

This short paper was my first assignment submitted for a course on Dante's Divine Comedy, taught by the wonderful Martin Eisner at Duke University during the Fall 2014 semester.

The paper discusses at a short passage of *Inferno* 8 which has treated by three different translations.
